PCA Cancer Analysis
================

Letâ€™s create a table to see how many samples of each cell we have.

    ## 
    ## ALL-B ALL-T   AML 
    ##    19     7    12

Randomly select two columns and plot them against each
other.

Run the PCA and plot
it.

From this plot, we can see that it is probable that sample 22 was
mislabeled as ALL-B, when it should be ALL-T.

Find out how much variation is explained by the first two components.

``` r
sum(pcaOut$sdev[1:2]^2)/sum(pcaOut$sdev^2)
```

    ## [1] 0.3582157

The first two components explain about 36% of the variation.
